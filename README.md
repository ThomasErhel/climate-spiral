# Climate Spiral Visualization

🌏 This project is an adaptation of Ed Hawkins' iconic "Climate Spiral" visualization using P5, React and TypeScript.

## Introduction

🌍 The Climate Spiral visualization was originally created by Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading. The visualization shows how the Earth's temperature has changed over time, with each year represented as a colored line on a spiral graph.

🎥 To learn more about how the visualization was created, you can watch Daniel Shiffman's video tutorial on how to code a p5.js version of the Climate Spiral: [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/rVBTxnRyOuE)

💻 This adaptation of the Climate Spiral uses P5, React and TypeScript to create a dynamic and interactive version of the visualization.

🔢 The data used in this project is sourced from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies: [GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP)](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)
